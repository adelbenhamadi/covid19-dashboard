        <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more
          severe diseases. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
        </p>
        <p>The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. 
          You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</p>  
        
        <div class="h5">Outbreak</div>

          On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-General declared the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak a public
          health
          emergency of international concern.
        </p>
       
         <div class="h5">How it spreads</div>
          Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
